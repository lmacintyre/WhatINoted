When creating a new test, create a class that implements the Test interface.
This interface has one method, Run, which takes in a StreamWriter and returns a boolean.
The StreamWriter is there for you to write any test output that you want in the Test Results file.
The Run method should return true if the test completely passed and false if any part of it failed.
Also make sure to include an instance of your test class in the static tests array in Program.cs.

That's it - running this project will run that test automatically and add its results to the text file.
